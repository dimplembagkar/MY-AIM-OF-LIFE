        <h4>The Aim of Life
            <br><br>
            Everyone has an aim in life. My aim is to become a coder. Means to do computer programming, make game, apps, websites and many more.
            <br><br>
            Computer programming is the lifeblood of modern life. Imagine for a moment what would happen if all computers suddenly disappeared tomorrow. No internet. No data. No connection. No convenience. 
            <br><br>
            Computer programming is a fundamental skill for so many different applications, not just software development or cutting-edge research into artificial intelligence. It makes banking more accessible, smooths out supply lines, and creates those fantastic online experiences we love. Programming means your favourite jeans are one click away, and governments can open services faster and more efficiently during a crisis. Amazing, isnâ€™t it?
