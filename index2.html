     <h4>  The Aim of Life
        <br><br>
Everyone has an aim in life. My aim is to become a doctor. To treat the people which are suffering from diseases. To become a doctor is a proud me and family members and all other citizens.
<br><br> 
I have excellent memory, problem-solving abilities, and excel in a science subject; therefore I decided to become a doctor. My nation is in desperate needs of medical specialists. I have my liking for medical. I admire the medical profession. It means service to humanity, helps to needy, and love to humanity to serve people is to serve god.
